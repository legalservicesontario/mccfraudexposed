BETWEEN:

LIVIE GRIMALDI, MCC licensed mortgage agents/brokers,and former MCC licensed member, individually and on
behalf of on their own behalf and on behalf of all others similarly situated
Plaintiffs

— and —

THE MORTGAGE CENTRE CANADA INC., RONALD KAM SHING LEE, HENRY TSI, and IBROKERPOWER CAPITAL INC. (an independently-owned MCC franchise)
Defendants

STATEMENT OF CLAIM (Proposed Class Proceeding)

A. NATURE OF PROCEEDING
This is a proposed class proceeding brought under the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 (“CPA”) on behalf of licensed mortgage agents who originated mortgages through Mortgage Centre Canada (“MCC”) franchise brokerages and who were deprived of pooled MCC network volume bonuses, trailer fees, and other lender incentives by the conduct of the Defendants.
The Plaintiffs seek (inter alia) damages for unpaid commissions, an accounting and tracing of misappropriated funds, constructive trust over assets acquired with diverted funds, declaratory relief, punitive damages, and Norwich Orders compelling third-party disclosure (FSRAO, CRA, banks, lenders, FiLogix, Newton, MCC head office) to trace the flow of funds.

B. THE PARTIES
The Plaintiffs are licensed mortgage agents in the Province of Ontario who, during the period 2015 to present, originated mortgage transactions while affiliated with MCC franchise brokerages, including iBrokerPower Capital Inc.
The Representative Plaintiff(s) named above will fairly and adequately represent the Class and have no conflict of interest with class members.
The Defendant Ronald Kam Shing Lee (“Lee”) is the Principal Broker of iBrokerPower Capital Inc.
The Defendant Henry Tsi (“Tsi”) is a co-owner of iBrokerPower Capital Inc.
The Defendant iBrokerPower Capital Inc. (“iBrokerPower”) is an independently-owned MCC franchise and a licensed Ontario mortgage brokerage.
The Defendant The Mortgage Centre Canada Inc. (“MCC”) is the national franchisor operating the MCC franchise network across Canada, including Ontario.
Ginkgo MIC Mortgage Investment Corporation (“Ginkgo MIC”) is a private mortgage investment corporation that, on information and belief, is co-owned and directed by Lee and Tsi. Ginkgo MIC is not currently named as a Defendant, but the Plaintiffs plead and will prove that diverted MCC network bonus funds and agent commission monies were used to capitalize or otherwise fund Ginkgo MIC, thereby enriching Lee and Tsi. The Plaintiffs reserve the right to add Ginkgo MIC or any other entity as a Defendant if evidence so requires.
The Plaintiffs further plead that other independently-owned MCC franchise brokerages and their principals may also have participated in the diversion and misappropriation of MCC network pooled volume bonuses. The Plaintiffs reserve the right to add additional franchise defendants upon discovery or evidence.

C. INDUSTRY PRACTICE — NETWORK-POOLED VOLUME BONUSES
Lenders (including but not limited to TD Canada Trust, Scotiabank, MCAP, First National, CIBC, Equitable Bank) pay volume bonuses to the MCC franchise network. These bonuses are calculated on aggregate origination volumes across all MCC franchises (i.e., pooled franchise production credited under MCC franchise codes), which is why bonus pools can be substantial.
Lender payments, franchise codes, and transaction details are recorded and tracked in industry software such as FiLogix Expert and Newton Velocity, which log for each transaction: lender, franchise code, originating agent identifier, commission, and bonus entitlement.
Under industry practice, brokerage agreements, franchise documents, and equity, the pooled MCC network bonuses must be disclosed and appropriately accounted for, and agents who contributed to the pooled production are entitled to a share or to disclosure sufficient to determine entitlement.

D. OVERVIEW OF THE SCHEME
From at least January 1, 2015 and continuing to the present, the Defendants engaged in a deliberate scheme with the following elements:
a. Concealment from agents of the existence, calculation and allocation of MCC network-pooled volume bonuses and trailer fees;
b. Retention and diversion of pooled bonus funds at the brokerage/franchise level (including transfers into accounts controlled by iBrokerPower and principals);
c. Use of diverted funds to pay inflated salaries and perks to principals and senior staff (for example, on information and belief Lee received annual compensation in excess of $120,000 and Tsi in excess of $100,000), to purchase or hold real estate, and to capitalize or fund related entities (including Ginkgo MIC);
d. Misrepresentations to agents that commission splits (typical 70/30 or 80/20 splits) and MCC franchise fees (approximately $300–$600 per month) constituted the full extent of compensation; and
e. Active or passive enabling by MCC head office by collecting franchise royalties while failing to supervise or enforce statutory disclosure obligations.
The practical effect of the scheme was to concentrate substantial network-pooled bonus pools (which properly belonged, in large part, to contributing agents across the MCC network) into the hands of iBrokerPower principals and related entities, causing substantial financial deprivation to agents.

E. REPRESENTATIVE EXAMPLES (PARTIAL, ILLUSTRATIVE)
Specific representative examples (on the information and belief of the Plaintiffs, to be proved at trial) include:
a. March 15, 2018 — An agent of iBrokerPower originated a $750,000 mortgage with TD Canada Trust. The transaction was recorded in FiLogix with MCC franchise code XXX; TD paid a volume bonus of approximately $7,500 to MCC franchise code XXX. No portion of that bonus was disclosed or remitted to the originating agent.
b. July 22, 2019 — An agent under iBrokerPower originated a $1,200,000 mortgage with MCAP. MCAP’s records (Newton Velocity) show a volume bonus payment of $12,000 attributable to the MCC franchise network; that payment was diverted and not distributed to the contributing agents.
c. Between 2016–2020, Plaintiffs have traced at least 45 deals generating approximately $400,000 in pooled bonuses that were not disclosed to or paid to contributing agents. Extrapolated across the MCC network and class membership, Plaintiffs estimate total diverted amounts in the order of $3–5 million.
The Plaintiffs will rely on FiLogix and Newton system data, lender bonus schedules, franchise agreements, internal brokerage ledgers, and bank records (when obtained) to prove the above examples.

F. DUTIES OWED AND BREACHES
The Defendants owed the Plaintiffs multiple legal obligations, including but not limited to:
a. Fiduciary duties (as Principal Broker, Lee owed duties of loyalty, disclosure and accounting to agents);
b. Statutory duties under the Mortgage Brokerages, Lenders and Administrators Act, 2006 (MBLAA) and FSRA regulations (including O. Reg. 188/08, s.15) to disclose direct or indirect incentives from lenders;
c. Employment Standards Act, 2000 (ESA) duties — commissions and bonuses are wages or compensation within the ESA framework and cannot be withheld by misclassification;
d. Common law duty of good faith and honest performance in contractual relationships (see Bhasin v. Hrynew principles); and
e. Franchisor supervisory obligations — MCC owed a duty to ensure franchise compliance and not to enable systematic concealment through its royalty or franchise model.
The Defendants breached the above duties by intentionally concealing payments, misclassifying agents to avoid ESA obligations, diverting pooled bonus funds for their own enrichment, and creating or participating in a conflict of interest structure.

G. CAUSES OF ACTION
The Plaintiffs plead claims including, but not limited to:
a. Civil fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation (deliberate concealment of entitlements and false statements about compensation);
b. Breach of fiduciary duty (as to principal brokers and those in supervisory positions);
c. Breach of statutory duties (MBLAA, FSRA regulations, ESA);
d. Breach of contract and duty of good faith; and
e. Unjust enrichment and entitlement to disgorgement/constructive trust.

H. CLASS PROCEEDING ELEMENTS — CPA (ss. 2 & 5)
The Plaintiffs bring this action under ss. 2 and 5 of the CPA. The Plaintiffs plead that the action satisfies the certification criteria in s.5(1):
a. Cause of action — the Statement discloses material causes of action (fraud, fiduciary breach, statutory breach, unjust enrichment);
b. Identifiable class — licensed mortgage agents who originated mortgages through MCC franchise brokerages in Ontario from January 1, 2015 to present and who were entitled to pooled MCC network bonuses;
c. Common issues — whether pooled bonuses existed and were paid to MCC, whether the payments were attributable to agents’ originations, whether the Defendants concealed or misappropriated the funds, and appropriate remedies;
d. Preferable procedure — a class proceeding is the only practical method to adjudicate the systemic concealment; individual actions would be inefficient and inequitable; and
e. Representative — the named Plaintiffs are adequate and able to represent the class.
The Plaintiffs will file a certification motion and supporting affidavit and factum addressing these criteria.

I. REMEDIES, ACCOUNTING, TRACING & CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST
The Plaintiffs seek:
a. An accounting of all pooled MCC network bonus payments, trailer fees, and incentives paid by lenders to MCC franchise codes and to iBrokerPower;
b. Traced disgorgement of funds diverted to iBrokerPower principals and related entities;
c. A constructive trust over assets, accounts, and properties (including corporate capitalization of Ginkgo MIC and identified real estate purchases) acquired with misappropriated funds;
d. Declaratory relief that Defendants acted unlawfully and in breach of duties;
e. General, special, aggravated, punitive and exemplary damages;
f. Pre-judgment and post-judgment interest; and
g. Costs on a substantial indemnity basis, given the alleged deliberate, systemic, and fraudulent misconduct.

J. NORWICH ORDERS / THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURE
To identify and quantify diverted funds and responsible wrongdoers, the Plaintiffs seek Norwich Orders (or equivalent third-party disclosure relief) compelling disclosure from:
a. Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRAO) — regulatory filings, audits, and compliance correspondence related to iBrokerPower and MCC franchise compliance;
b. Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) — corporate tax returns, T4/T5 filings, and related schedules for iBrokerPower and entities benefiting from diverted funds;
c. Banks and lenders (TD, Scotiabank, MCAP, First National, CIBC, Equitable and others) — records of volume bonus payments, transfer instructions, deposit details, receiving account numbers and beneficiary information tied to MCC franchise codes and iBrokerPower;
d. FiLogix Expert and Newton Velocity — system records showing transactions, franchise codes, agent identifiers, commission rates and bonus allocations for the MCC network;
e. MCC head office — franchise agreements, bonus distribution policies, royalty records, and communications with lenders; and
f. Other MCC franchise brokerages — documents evidencing receipt or diversion of pooled bonus payments where relevant.
The Plaintiffs will seek these Norwich Orders as necessary to trace the path of monies from lenders → MCC franchise network → iBrokerPower principals/Ginkgo MIC/other recipients.

K. OTHER RELIEF
The Plaintiffs seek such further relief as this Honourable Court considers just, including an order permitting the addition of other franchise defendants if discovery shows their participation in the diversion scheme.

L. LIMITATION, JURISDICTION & PLACE OF TRIAL
The Plaintiffs plead that this Statement of Claim is within the time limits applicable or that any limitation defenses are waived or estopped by concealment. The Plaintiffs will address limitation and jurisdictional matters in the certification motion and at trial.
The Plaintiffs propose that the action proceed in Toronto, Ontario.

M. EXHIBITS (to be attached to affidavit / certification record)
Plaintiffs rely on, and will attach on certification and Norwich motions, inter alia:
a. Sample agent commission statements and deal submission records;
b. FiLogix / Newton Velocity screenshots or reports showing franchise codes and bonus allocations;
c. Lender bonus program materials and broker compensation guides;
d. MCC franchise agreements and royalty schedules;
e. Internal brokerage accounting entries (where available);
f. Title searches for property acquisitions connected to principals;
g. Payroll and corporate filings (when obtained); and
h. Affidavits from former agents corroborating concealment.

RELIEF SOUGHT (SUMMARY)

Certification of this action as a class proceeding under the CPA and appointment of representative plaintiff(s);
Damages for unpaid commissions and bonuses (in excess of $5,000,000, or such amount to be proven);
